# sEMG_GestureRecognition

Electromyographic gesture recognition is the problem of classifying sequences of EMG data
recorded by specialized devices into known well-defined gestures. In this project, this 
is achieved by recording EMG sequences using the Myo armband, which is then classified by 
a CNN into the different Poses performed.

The following are the poses performed by the subjects:

Class - Pose:
0 - unmarked data,
1 - hand at rest, 
2 - hand clenched in a fist, 
3 - wrist flexion,
4 – wrist extension,
5 – radial deviations,
6 - ulnar deviations,
7 - extended palm.
